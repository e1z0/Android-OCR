# Android-OCR
Xamarin Android Optical Character Recognition Application Proof Of Concept (PoC) using tesseract-ocr as the backend, all source and it's libraries are open source

This was intended to be first working Xamarin Android Optical Character Recognition Application for Android with async and wait methods for it. Of course it does not use any of recognition outside your mobile app (not cloud based). It does everything in it's backend, i mean the all OCR works in the app backend on your mobile device, bacause of that it takes a lot of resources, but you can always tune scan and recognition settings.
It is based on the [Xamarin.Tesseract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/halkar/Tesseract.Xamarin/) library which is a wrapper for [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/) library.
